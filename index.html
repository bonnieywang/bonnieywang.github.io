        Our first lecture! While I've dabbled in HTML before, I never TRULY understood what all the coding jargon meant, so it was really nice to have it broken down in an easier to understand way! Specifically, knowing how the different coding languages (ex. HTML, CSS, and Javascript) relate and pair with each other was something I didn't really understand before. I've always wanted to take a coding course so I'm super excited for everything we'll cover in this class!

        I'm particularly interested in learning about building scrollytelly websites, 3D interactive viewers, and how to design playable/interactive websites!
