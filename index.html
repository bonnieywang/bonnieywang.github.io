    <h3>Class Reflections</h3>
    <h4>Web Dev 101 - January 7th, 2025</h4>
    <p>
        Our first lecture! While I've dabbled in HTML before, I never TRULY understood what all the coding jargon meant, so it was really nice to have it broken down in an easier to understand way! Specifically, knowing how the different coding languages (ex. HTML, CSS, and Javascript) relate and pair with each other was something I didn't really understand before. I've always wanted to take a coding course so I'm super excited for everything we'll cover in this class!
        <br>
        I'm particularly interested in learning about building scrollytelly websites, 3D interactive viewers, and how to design playable/interactive websites!

    <h3>MRP Description</h3>
    <p>
        Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a lesser known yet common neuropathy involving trauma to the peripheral nervous system, often leading to devastating consequences that can leave limbs motionless and insensate1. Most PNIs result from unexpected accidents and treatment is filled with uncertainty given variation in injury, treatment options, and recovery timeline. As a result, patients often feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to expect, especially in a clinical setting. Although the digital space has made it easier for individuals to seek out health information, educational resources on this topic are sparse and often limited by a lack of engagement and a high reading level.
        <br>
        To bridge this gap, NerveUs aims to be an accessible, comprehensive, and interactive educational tool that addresses patient pain points by providing clear information about PNI, the treatment timeline, procedure options, and recovery expectations. The resource will be developed using a human-centered approach and feature 2D and 3D visual assets, an interactive scrollytelly feature, and content in plain language to help patients and their families better visualize and understand their injury. Accessibility will be a high priority to ensure the educational resource is available to patients with limb mobility limitations and low health or digital literacy. This resource is intended to be used throughout their treatment journey, specifically in preparation for visiting peripheral nerve injury clinics.
