                Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a lesser known yet common neuropathy involving trauma to the peripheral nervous system, often leading to devastating consequences that can leave limbs motionless and insensate1. Most PNIs result from unexpected accidents and treatment is filled with uncertainty given variation in injury, treatment options, and recovery timeline. As a result, patients often feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to expect, especially in a clinical setting. Although the digital space has made it easier for individuals to seek out health information, educational resources on this topic are sparse and often limited by a lack of engagement and a high reading level.
