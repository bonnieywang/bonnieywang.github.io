            <h3>Wednesday</h3>
            <p>
                In this first week, our whole team assembled to have an initial brainstorming session about what our project could entail. While the general concept was established, there were still a lot of aspects of the interactivity that needed to be fleshed out.
                
                We prepared for our project pitch and delegated roles for the remainder of the week, leading up to the submission of our pre-production document drafts.
                - Realizing we only had two weeks before the submission deadline, we made a big push to finish research and concept art before our next meeting.

            <p>               
                I participated in conducting visual/informational research on coyote and great horned owl for our scripting next week. This included compiling information, sound clips, and images online in preparation for scripting, concept art, and visual asset creation later.

            <h3>Sunday</h3> 
            <p>            
                I also created sketches for the animals above and our titular character Beanie (my dog!) to help generate ideas for concept art next week:

            <p>
                In terms of my role as a UI/UX designer, I helped to brainstorm some typography options that would help evoke the atmosphere of our moodboard and began to create a list of the different types of text and interactive features/icons we would need.
                <br>
                Priya and Emily did a lot of the upfront work to help us figure out what our visual style might be, and outline the narrative and story mechanisms. As a support role, I helped provide feedback and began looking into the development tools/skills that would be required to integrate the interactions.
            </p>

            <h3>Plans for next week:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Together, decide on visual style.</li>
                <li>Once script is finished, create a storyboard.</li>
                <li>Assemble design document draft for submission including the following pages:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Project Overview</li>
                    <li>Workflow</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Timeline (updated - not including user testing - and fleshed out)</li>
                        <li>Team Roles</li>
                    </ul>

                To better visualize our preliminary ideas, I helped draft a very basic storyboard on Procreate. I included the primary scenes that would be needed, including the forest and parallax mechanism, what would happen when an animal was found, and how the user would wrap up the story and solve the mystery.     
                <br>            
                This helped me walk through our ideas in more logical steps and visualize how interactions might work. It also helped me identify problems we might face later that I didn’t think of during our initial planning stages.

            <p>

                I also created refined sketches for our concept art. We decided because some of our animals would be found in similar areas, each animal’s silhouette needed to really stand out. To try and solve the visual problem, we decided to refine our sketches drawing only the silhouettes first, and then adding line art to describe the features.

            <h3>Thursday</h3>                
            <p>               
                We had a team meeting today where we provided updates and feedback on the work we had completed since Tuesday. Everyone is doing such great work and it feels amazing to see all the progress we have already in week two (I couldn’t imagine being here at the beginning of February)! Afterwards, I continued to compile images for our mood board, develop our colour palette, and test out various font options that Emily and I gathered. I helped set up the templates for our design document in Figma so it would be easy to copy and replicate, began populating the various sections by describing our design process and inserting progress photos.

            <h3>Friday</h3> 
            <p>            
                After receiving all the assets from my group members, I compiled screenshots and images of our pre-production work on Figma and assembled our design document. Using the visual references we had gathered, I expanded on our thought process and justified the design decisions that were made.            </p>
