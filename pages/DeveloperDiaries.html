            <h3>Wednesday</h3>
            <p>
                In this first week, our whole team assembled to have an initial brainstorming session about what our project could entail. While the general concept was established, there were still a lot of aspects of the interactivity that needed to be fleshed out.
                
                We prepared for our project pitch and delegated roles for the remainder of the week, leading up to the submission of our pre-production document drafts.
                - Realizing we only had two weeks before the submission deadline, we made a big push to finish research and concept art before our next meeting.

            <h3>Friday</h3>                
            <p>               
                I participated in conducting visual/informational research on coyote and great horned owl for our scripting next week. This included compiling information, sound clips, and images online in preparation for scripting, concept art, and visual asset creation later.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Sunday</h3> 
            <p>            
                I also created sketches for the animals above and our titular character Beanie (my dog!) to help generate ideas for concept art next week:

            <p>
                In terms of my role as a UI/UX designer, I helped to brainstorm some typography options that would help evoke the atmosphere of our moodboard and began to create a list of the different types of text and interactive features/icons we would need.
                <br>
                Priya and Emily did a lot of the upfront work to help us figure out what our visual style might be, and outline the narrative and story mechanisms. As a support role, I helped provide feedback and began looking into the development tools/skills that would be required to integrate the interactions.
            </p>

            <h3>Plans for next week:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Together, decide on visual style.</li>
                <li>Once script is finished, create a storyboard.</li>
                <li>Assemble design document draft for submission including the following pages:</li>

            <p>
                To better visualize our preliminary ideas, I helped draft a very basic storyboard on Procreate. I included the primary scenes that would be needed, including the forest and parallax mechanism, what would happen when an animal was found, and how the user would wrap up the story and solve the mystery.     
                <br>            
                This helped me walk through our ideas in more logical steps and visualize how interactions might work. It also helped me identify problems we might face later that I didn’t think of during our initial planning stages.

            <br>  

            <p>

                I also created refined sketches for our concept art. We decided because some of our animals would be found in similar areas, each animal’s silhouette needed to really stand out. To try and solve the visual problem, we decided to refine our sketches drawing only the silhouettes first, and then adding line art to describe the features.

                We had a team meeting today where we provided updates and feedback on the work we had completed since Tuesday. Everyone is doing such great work and it feels amazing to see all the progress we have already in week two (I couldn’t imagine being here at the beginning of February)! Afterwards, I continued to compile images for our mood board, develop our colour palette, and test out various font options that Emily and I gathered. I helped set up the templates for our design document in Figma so it would be easy to copy and replicate, began populating the various sections by describing our design process and inserting progress photos.

                After receiving all the assets from my group members, I compiled screenshots and images of our pre-production work on Figma and assembled our design document. Using the visual references we had gathered, I expanded on our thought process and justified the design decisions that were made.            </p>

            <p>
                Today we had our midway check-in meeting with Alex, which was helpful in making sure we were on the right track. Stef and Priya had some great development questions and we were able to discuss the scope of our project and what a feasible deliverable would be for our demo presentation.

            <br>

            <p>
                In terms of personal work, I refined the animal sketches from last week, as well as provided a digitized sketch of Beanie.

            <p>

                This week, I’ll be focusing on refining the storyboard to help the development team get a better idea of the assets they will need to consider for each interaction. Our main focus will be figuring out what our coding limitations are, and what needs to be accomplished via code or other avenues (ex. After Effects) as we prepare to full send into development next week.

                Today I worked on refining our storyboard so we can identify the specific micro-interactions that will be needed at the different points in our story. This helped me think about the actual scope of our project, and identify where we might want to use fakery to simplify the amount of interactions we need to code in.

            <p>            
                As always, the process of working through each scene is tedious and brings up more questions than answers, but it was good to get those thoughts translated to paper to bring up with my group members and with Alex later on.

                We narrowed down our font pairings to a few different options. To make our final decisions, I used sketches we created for the wireframe and notepad and overlayed the text options on top. This helped us see the fonts in context. I also experimented with presenting the main text in different font sizes to mimic the style of the Reuters scrollytelling piece, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-CASUALTIES/lbpggbmrapq/"> Awash in Grief</a>. We decided on having no dialogue boxes to simplify the interface and to make the project feel more like a storybook rather than a game.             
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> 
                As a team, we decided on using Volkorn for the main text and Providence Sans Pro - bold/regular for the notepad. A key consideration was what typefaces would be accessible (ex. Adobe fonts vs. free/Google fonts). We are able to use Adobe fonts for text that is apart of a larger image that we plan to export as pngs, however it would be better to use a Google font for reactive text that would coded directly on the site.

            <h3>Saturday</h3>
            <p>
                I first refined Stef’s notepad sketch, using the same brush pack as Emily to keep the style consistent.            
            </p>
            <br>  

            <p>
                With the finished notepad asset, I created PNGs of each notepad page with animal facts. During this process, I realized that we had a LOT of text, and to keep the pages appropriate for our audience and highlight the image, we'd have to cut out a lot of it.            
            </p>
              
            <img src="../images/notepad_skunk.png" style="height:500px;"  alt="Notepad page">
            <br>

            <p>               
                Emily and I also discussed the problem of resolution of the trees and bushes as you went deeper into the scene. We wanted to maintain the sketchy, watercolour textures, but to accommodate for desktop size, our Procreate canvas had to be very large. Because of the brush texture we were using, lines began to look pixelated when working on the new canvas dimensions.            
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>            
                We considered using illustrator to create each environment asset, but we weren't sure how to maintain the style we wanted. I knew of a feature called image trace, and used that to experiment with creating a vector version of our assets. I exported Emily's renders to Illustrator and used image trace to turn it into a vectorized image. I played with advanced settings, increasing the number of paths and corners to preserve as many of the colours and brush strokes as possible. We also played around with adding noise on a multiply layer and a flat color overlay on Illustrator to add back some of the grain/watercolour feeling. Although the new version looks slightly different, we figured out a workflow to create scalable vector assets are scalable that still have a hand-drawn feeling.

                Stef gave me and Priya a brief tutorial on how the parallax scrolling was coded using the Scrollmagic Javascript library. This was really insightful as I was able to think about the interactions that they had to code in, and had a more realistic understanding of what could be done, especially in the next one and a half weeks.

            <p>
                Today, I made some revised Beanie sketches for reference. I tried to replicate the style/vibe of some of the inspiration images we had to the best of my ability. Unfortunately, this was a bit of a slower week for me due to other tight deadlines, but I'm eager to get back on it for the final week of development!

                Created the text placements to export as PNGs for Stef following the Reuters scrollytelling piece, highlighting key/fun words.

            <h3>Wednesday</h3>
            <p>
                Finished up text placements, worked with Stef to make sure the PNGs weren’t blurry and the placement fit with the other assets. I also started working on design document — fixing up previous slides and updating with new information.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                Also created a design document checklist to use with the rest of the group — I wanted to take on more of the design document since Emily has been busy with assets and stef and priya with development, but I felt it would be easier for them to fill out their corresponding sections in the design doc so I wouldn’t have to guess what their workflow was. To make the transition as seamless as possible, I provided screenshots from previous design documents and a written description the type of content they could add.        
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                While fixing up the design document, I’d help test out our project (Stef was coding beside me) and help troubleshoot with ChatGPT and logical conceptualization of how the code could work. We were able to figure out how to make the scrollbar clickable (it would be there but wouldn’t be interactive) and a page loading issue, where sometimes scrolling wouldn’t work and the page had to be refreshed multiple times before scrolling properly.
            </p>

            <h3>Thursday</h3>
            <p>
                Continued to work on the design document — finding citations, reconstructing our user journey map to reflect the changes we made and to make it more readable, etc.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                I also took on the task of colouring Beanie based on Emily’s sketches and helping create an the animal assets to help out with Emily’s workload. I really admire Emily’s playful yet detailed colouring style and used her raccoon asset as a guide for how to approach colouring Beanie.
           </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                To try to enhance the cartoon/children’s book-like aesthetic, Stef and I created scrappy initial sketches and traded them with each other to help get different perspectives with the drawing. This was a really fun exercise and helped us think more creatively, since we were trying to enhance someone else’s sketches rather than our own.

                Long work day today! I finished up colouring Beanie and his bandana, exporting the assets to Stef to integrate into our code, and worked on finishing up another animal asset. After finalizing the sketches for the toad and owl, I did the line art for both while Stef was still coding and coloured the owl asset. After this, I handed off the toad lineart to Stef to complete and wrapped up the day by working on the design document - adding in citations and editing sections to reflect the new scope of our project.

                After looking at all of the completed assets, I had been feeling like the notepad asset didn’t fit as much. I decided to redo it to match the style of the other images — at this point I felt like I had a good grasp of how to design and colour it and felt confident enough to take it on. I simplified the top part of the notepad which was drawing a lot of attention (and frankly did not make sense now that I look at it — why would you have a spiral notepad with a tear away feature??) and changed the colour of the pen to match beanies bandana and create a more cohesive look. I also layered a paper texture on multiply overtop to achieve a scrapbook-like effect and applied a similar purple-blue gradient to unify the notepad with the background. After finishing the asset, I combined it with the new animal assets to recreate the completed notepad entries.

            <p>
                After this, I helped out with fixing the style of the buttons — Emily and I wanted them to also have a playful feeling — currently our buttons were styled in CSS but felt almost ad-like to us, especially when leaving the quiz. Emily helped design the new buttons and I  was able to go into the code and replace the button with a png (this sounds easy but took me a good 7-8 hours to put in 4 buttons).             </p>
