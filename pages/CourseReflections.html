            <p>Our first lecture! While I've dabbled in HTML before, I never TRULY understood what all the coding jargon meant, so it was really nice to have it broken down in an easier to understand way! Specifically, knowing how the different coding languages (ex. HTML, CSS, and Javascript) relate and pair with each other was something I didn't really understand before. I've always wanted to take a coding course so I'm super excited for everything we'll cover in this class!</p>

            <p>I'm starting to understand why they call them coding languages :') I feel like I'm in over my head trying to figure out what each tag does. Something important I learned while building my website was that capitalization matters! My css wasn't linking properly to my home page when I commited the changes even though my webpage looked fine locally because it was linked as .CSS instead of .css. While it's satisfying to understand when it finally works, it's also time consuming and frustrating when it doesn't.</p>

            <p>Most important takeaways:</p> <!--Paragraph should not wrap list-->
                <ul>
                    <li>Arrows can help convey movement and object state changes in an effective way that doesn’t clutter the storyboard. It’s easier to vary the type of arrow to convey different meanings rather than putting too much effort into the drawings themselves since changes are likely to occur.</li>
                    <li>Formatting of scripting is important for conveying ideas to your team and clients. An interesting thing I learned was that narrower text is easier to read and its good practice format your scripts to be narrower, especially for voice actors, or people who will be reviewing the script in depth.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Everyone's storyboard presentations in class today were great and I learned so much! I liked the idea of having an "Anatomy of a Slide" slide to start off the presentation to explain any categorization that is being used in the storyboard. It was also nice to create a list of storyboard elements that I can reference for future projects.</p>
