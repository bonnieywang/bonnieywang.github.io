            <p>Our first lecture! While I've dabbled in HTML before, I never TRULY understood what all the coding jargon meant, so it was really nice to have it broken down in an easier to understand way! Specifically, knowing how the different coding languages (ex. HTML, CSS, and Javascript) relate and pair with each other was something I didn't really understand before. I've always wanted to take a coding course so I'm super excited for everything we'll cover in this class!</p>

            <p>I'm starting to understand why they call them coding languages :') I feel like I'm in over my head trying to figure out what each tag does. Something important I learned while building my website was that capitalization matters! My css wasn't linking properly to my home page when I commited the changes even though my webpage looked fine locally because it was linked as .CSS instead of .css. While it's satisfying to understand when it finally works, it's also time consuming and frustrating when it doesn't.</p>
